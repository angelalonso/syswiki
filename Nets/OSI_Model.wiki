== Comparison to TCP/IP model ==
The Internet application layer maps to the OSI application layer, presentation layer, and most of the session layer.
The TCP/IP transport layer maps to the graceful close function of the OSI session layer as well as the OSI transport layer.
The internet layer performs functions as those in a subset of the OSI network layer.
The link layer corresponds to the OSI data link layer and may include similar functions as the physical layer, as well as some protocols of the OSI's network layer.
