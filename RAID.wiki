= RAID =

== Check current status ==
cat /proc/mdstat

== Force a disk to be marked as FAIL ==
mdadm --manage /dev/md1 --fail /dev/sdb2

== Get serial Number ==
hdparm -i /dev/sdf | grep Serial

== Add new Drive to RAID ==
=== Prepare the drive's partition ===
sgdisk /dev/sda -R /dev/sdf
=== The drive then needs to be assigned a new random UUID: === 
sgdisk -G /dev/sdf
=== Finally, add the partitions to the RAID ===
For each mdX do the following: 
mdadm /dev/md0 -a /dev/sdb1

== KNOWN ISSUE: mdadm: cannot find /dev/sdf4: No such file or directory ==
mdadm /dev/md3 -r failed
