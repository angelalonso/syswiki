== Basics ==

=== Container, Get a container IP ===
docker inspect <container ID> | grep IPAddress

=== Container, Get the Volumes mounted on a container ===
docker inspect -f '{{ .Mounts }}' containerid
 
== Docker hub ==
Before starting
docker login
 
=== Image, Create an image ===
From the directory where the Dockerfile is located. Tag it on creation time:
docker build . -t <account>/<repo>:<version>

=== Image, push an image ===
If we followed the below mentioned tagging standards
docker push <account>/<repo>:<version>
 
=== Image, Run an image ===
docker run --name <name> -tdi /bin/bash
 
=== Image, Tag an image ===
(if we follow standards like the one at docker hub)
docker tag <account>/<repo>:<version>
 
== System, Clean up ==                                                                                                                                                                                        
CAREFUL: this cleans up deeply
docker system prune
